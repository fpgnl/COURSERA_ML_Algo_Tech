About this Course
This course covers the core algorithms and techniques used in AI and ML, including approaches that use pre-trained large-language models (LLMs). You will explore supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms, as well as deep learning approaches, including how these operate in pre-trained LLMs. The course emphasizes the practical application of these techniques and their strengths and limitations in solving different types of business problems.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Implement, evaluate, and explain supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning algorithms.
2. Apply feature selection and engineering techniques to improve model performance.
3. Describe deep learning models for complex AI tasks.
4. Assess the suitability of various AI & ML techniques for specific business problems.

To be successful in this course, you should have intermediate programming knowledge of Python, plus basic knowledge of AI and ML capabilities, and newer capabilities through generative AI (GenAI) and pretrained large language models (LLM). Familiarity with statistics is also recommended.
